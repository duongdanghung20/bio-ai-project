# AI plays game with Neuro-evolution

## Description
* This project was created to do the final examination of __Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence__ course in University of Trento, 2021/2022 (Spring Semester).
* __Neuro Evolution__: A type of Artificial Intelligence that uses Evolutionary Algorithms to generate Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), parameters, topology and rules.
* This is a project applied Neuro Evolution to create AI agents that automatically play simple computer games.
* The games included:
    * Snake-Xenzia
    * Lunar Lander
    * Bipedal Walker
