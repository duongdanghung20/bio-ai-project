# bio-ai-project

Project to apply neuroevolution to different reinforcement learning environments. Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) algorithm is used to evolve agents in Open AI-gym environments and our own PyGame snake environment.

## Structure

The different evironments are organized in corresponding folders. Scripts for simulating the environments can be found inside the folders. Change the config files to change parameters of neuroevolution.
